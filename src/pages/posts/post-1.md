# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2022-07-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

The frontmatter is a block of metadata at the top of the file that provides information about the content. In this case, the frontmatter includes the title, publication date, description, author, image, and tags of the blog post.
The content of the blog post is written in Markdown format, which is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. The content includes headings, lists, and code blocks.
The code block at the end of the file is written in Java programming language and demonstrates a simple "Hello, World!" program.
By creating a Markdown file with frontmatter in the `src/pages/posts/` directory, you can easily add new blog posts to your Astro website.
Step 4: Displaying Blog Posts on the Homepage
To display the list of blog posts on the homepage of your Astro website, you can use the following code snippet in the `src/pages/index.astro` file:
